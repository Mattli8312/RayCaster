# RayCasting Engine [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/Mattli8312/RayCaster/blob/main/LICENSE)

## OverView

This is a RayCasting "Engine" implemented in python using various python modules. The GUI was implemented in pygame, a common python library used for rendering 2D images/frames in the terminal. This project was inspired by my interests in computer graphics and learning technqiues for rendering 3D terrains. This Engine is a simple implementation of a ray caster which will render a 2D maze-like structure in 3D. In this README, I will provide all details including documentation, development, applications, installation, optimizations, and contributions. This program is still in development and needs a lot more work, but this is the baseline of the RayCasting Engine which you can play around with :).

## Installation

In order to run this application, you will need to install pygame and the most recent version of python, specifically python 3 and above.

Simply Clone this repository to a folder in your local system:

```
$ cd FolderName
$ git clone https://github.com/Mattli8312/RayCaster.git
```

Then, If you don't have pygame installed, install pygame via pip:

```
$ python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
```
