## OverView

This is a RayCasting "Engine" implemented in python using various python modules. The GUI was implemented in pygame, a common python library used for rendering 2D images/frames in the terminal. This project was inspired by my interests in computer graphics and learning technqiues for rendering 3D terrains. This Engine is a simple implementation of a ray caster which will render a 2D maze-like structure in 3D. In this README, I will provide all details including documentation, development, applications, installation, optimizations, and contributions.
